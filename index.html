<p>
  The perfect start for a road trip starts 30 minutes from the English border in North-Wales, here lies the coastal town of Llandudno.
</p>
<p>The city has shown origins from 1284, but it is proof of civilization dated back to the stone age in Llandudno. The particular admiration of this town is the colorful style of the buildings that line up in the harbor, hills to climb up and see the city view and an award-winning pier you can enjoy the sea view.</p>

<p>
  Llandudno have small restaurants, and café`s, hotels for an overnight stay and shopping possibilities and it is all located in the nearby streets to the harbor, and why not enjoy culinary food at Lawton`s Café Grill which offers different types of traditional British food.
</p>
<p>It is worth experiencing a few hours at lunchtime in this little town in the Irish Sea. Further, why not a visit the town with the world longest town name, this town can be found only a few miles away from Llandudno and is called: Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.
 </p>
<p>From this town and Llandudno goes the the well-known road A470 that has been awarded multiple times as United Kingdom’s most excellent road has a starting point at Llandudno and would be a great option towards Snowdonia </p>
<p>Only 30 minutes into A470 you will experience small villages with old stone buildings and ancient bridges that give an authentic experience of Wales and the Welsh countryside, old pubs tempting with lager on each side of the road and driving over an over the hundred-year-old stone bridge itself is unique.</p>

<p>
Climbing up towards Snowdonia, you arrive ice roads and extraordinary views with hills and mountains on all horizons which is Snowdonia on the best, a stop on each pit stops will probably happen to take pictures of every hill and snowy mountaintop.
</p>
<p>The mountain hiking is one of the best-selling points of Snowdonia and if you enjoy a walk or mountain climbing, then Snowdonia can offer some of UK`s best hikes with trails on each pit stop. The hiking trails take you over rivers and give sights of waterfalls, and the paths are of stone plates, which makes it easier to travel on the track.</p>

<p>
Essentialy, an authentic experience on your road trip is to leave the touristic roads A470 and A5 and head for small side roads which is located on the hills and mountains, these roads are tiny and can give some high pulse with high drops on the sides and trails with not much space to drive on.

</p>
<p>There are no cars on the roads and no tourists in the hiking tracks; you have miles of miles for yourself to explore landscape, hills and mountains tops in front of you, there is a feeling of freedom standing there with fresh mountain air and look into the desolate horizon of Snowdonia. It is what makes the small side roads so unique and authentic to explore and worth driving through, and is worth exploring on your road trip.</p>

<p>
The side road takes you back on A470, which shows sundown of the lakes in South-Snowdonia. It is time for finding a village for overnight, and Snowdonia can offer many small and authentic villages on the way to South Snowdonia, and on the tip of South Snowdonia lies Machynlleth.

</p>
<p> A little town, with two streets only and a clock tower in the middle of the street, but this village has a lot to give their visitors to provide them with authentic buildings and local food and beer. It is very welcoming Village that has a few hotels, but shows the best through Maenllwyd Guest House and this is a recommended place for overnight. </p>
<p>The small pink guest house has only five rooms, and you are welcomed by the owner that shows you an old but charming room; breakfast is included which of is an excellent traditional Welsh breakfast, which is served to your table when immediately you walk into the breakfast hall.</p>

<p>
  After a long day of the road trip through Snowdonia, a dedicated meal is essential, and if you ask the owner of Maenllwyd Guest House, he will recommend old pubs and restaurants to eat on or have a lager, if you like wine he recommends a wine based restaurant. The wine-based restaurant is located on Wynnstay Hotel in middle of the village, here you have a large selection of Italian wines everything from a proper Barolo and Barbaresco to Amarone and traditional Welsh food is served such as Welsh lamb and Welsh Cheese.


</p>
<p>  Villages such as Machynlleth is a very typical Welsh village, and the locals are using Welsh language instad of English to each other which gives an authentic feeling, and it is an experience which makes you think you that you are not in the United Kingdom but another part of Europe. </p>

<p> So why should tourists road tripping through Snowdonia? Because such a road trip that takes you through Snowdonia takes one day, and the experience of driving from Llandudno throughout Snowdonia on small roads is an experience all tourists should explore. </p>
<p>Furthermore, because the Welsh country side has so much authentic to offer it is an an exceptional experience for tourists that prefer nature, mountains, beautiful landscape or just enjoy what the small villages can offer. You are into a treat of what Snowdonia can show.</p>
